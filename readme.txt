This code is for solving various instances of the iphone-game "sole", automatically.

It has both a version of the A*-search algorithm and a variant of breadth-first search (BFS) for searching
through the state space.

It has a couple of default ball setups, but one can modify it to use any setup desired.
Ex1: (1,4), (2,2).
Ex2: (3,4), (2,2), (5,4).
Ex3: (1,1), (2,2), (2,4), (3,6).
Ex4: (1,1), (3,2), (5,4), (3,6).
Ex5: (2,1), (2,6), (3,2), (3,4), (5,2), (6,1).
